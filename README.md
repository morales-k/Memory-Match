# Memory-Match
A coffee & donut themed matching game built with React & CSS. All card icons are SVGs, created using Adobe XD. This matching game features animated card flips, a total score, a reset button and a card flip count. Each SVG is returned with a unique function, allowing all icons to be imported as components. Each icon is added to an array, which is then doubled and randomized using the Fischer Yates shuffle, so no two play throughs are the same.
