# Memory-Match
A coffee & donut themed matching game built with React & CSS. All card icons are SVGs, created using Adobe XD. This matching game features animated card flips, multiple game modes, a flip count, a total score and a reset button. Each SVG is returned with a unique function, allowing all icons to be imported as components. Cards are randomized using the Fischer Yates shuffle, so no two play throughs are the same.
